# (WIP) Jsan

Jsan is a simple, single-header JSON parser for C/C++.

## Include into your Project

1. **Copy-Paste** the `jsan.h` file into your project's source directory.
2. **Define the implementation** in at least one translation unit using `#define JSAN_IMPL` just before the `jsan.h` is included.
3. **Include and use it** with `#include "jsan.h"`.

## Example Usage

```c
#define JSAN_IMPL
#include "jsan.h"
```
